# Tutorial: Creating a Snake Game with Python's Turtle Graphics

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a simple Snake Game using Python's Turtle Graphics module. The game will involve controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

We will also be using the built-in Turtle Graphics module in Python, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

## Getting Started

First, let's set up the project structure. Create a new folder for the Snake Game and create the following files inside it:

1. `main.py`: The main game file containing the game loop and initialization.
2. `snake.py`: A module containing the Snake class to handle the snake's behavior.
3. `food.py`: A module containing the Food class to handle the food's behavior.
4. `scoreboard.py`: A module containing the Scoreboard class to manage the game score.

## Step 1: Setting up the Main Game File (`main.py`)

```python
from turtle import Screen
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from scoreboard import Scoreboard
import time

screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.bgcolor("black")
screen.title("My Snake Game")
screen.tracer(0)

snake = Snake()
food = Food()
scoreboard = Scoreboard()

screen.listen()
screen.onkey(snake.up, "Up")
screen.onkey(snake.down, "Down")
screen.onkey(snake.left, "Left")
screen.onkey(snake.right, "Right")

game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    screen.update()
    time.sleep(0.1)
    snake.move()

    # Detect collision with food.
    if snake.head.distance(food) < 15:
        food.refresh()
        snake.extend()
        scoreboard.increase_score()

    # Detect collision with wall.
    if snake.head.xcor() > 280 or snake.head.xcor() < -280 or snake.head.ycor() > 280 or snake.head.ycor() < -280:
        scoreboard.reset_game()
        snake.reset_snake()

    # Detect collision with tail.
    for segment in snake.segments:
        if segment == snake.head:
            pass
        elif snake.head.distance(segment) < 10:
            scoreboard.reset_game()
            snake.reset_snake()

screen.exitonclick()
```

In the main game file, we first import the necessary modules (`Screen`, `Snake`, `Food`, `Scoreboard`, and `time`). Then, we set up the game screen with the desired width, height, and background color.

We initialize the game components: the snake, the food, and the scoreboard. We also set up the event listeners for arrow keys to control the snake's movement.

Inside the game loop (`while game_is_on`), we update the screen, move the snake, and check for collisions with food, walls, and the snake's own tail. Depending on the collision, we call appropriate functions to handle these scenarios.

## Step 2: Creating the `Snake` Class (`snake.py`)

```python
from turtle import Turtle

STARTING_POSITIONS = [(0, 0), (-20, 0), (-40, 0)]
MOVE_DISTANCE = 20
UP = 90
DOWN = 270
LEFT = 180
RIGHT = 0

class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.segments = []
        self.create_snake()
        self.head = self.segments[0]

    def create_snake(self):
        for position in STARTING_POSITIONS:
            self.add_segment(position)

    def add_segment(self, position):
        new_segment = Turtle("square")
        new_segment.color("white")
        new_segment.penup()
        new_segment.goto(position)
        self.segments.append(new_segment)

    def reset_snake(self):
        for seg in self.segments:
            seg.goto(1000, 1000)
        self.segments.clear()
        self.create_snake()
        self.head = self.segments[0]

    def extend(self):
        self.add_segment(self.segments[-1].position())

    def move(self):
        for seg_num in range(len(self.segments) - 1, 0, -1):
            new_x = self.segments[seg_num - 1].xcor()
            new_y = self.segments[seg_num - 1].ycor()
            self.segments[seg_num].goto(new_x, new_y)
        self.head.forward(MOVE_DISTANCE)

    def up(self):
        if self.head.heading() != DOWN:
            self.head.setheading(UP)

    def down(self):
        if self.head.heading() != UP:
            self.head.setheading(DOWN)

    def left(self):
        if self.head.heading() != RIGHT:
            self.head.setheading(LEFT)

    def right(self):
        if self.head.heading() != LEFT:
            self.head.setheading(RIGHT)
```

In the `snake.py` file, we define the `Snake` class responsible for managing the snake's behavior. The class contains methods to create the initial snake, add new segments, extend the snake, move the snake, and handle its direction.

## Step 3: Creating the `Food` Class (`food.py`)

```python
from turtle import Turtle
import random

class Food(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shape("circle")
        self.penup()
        self.shapesize(stretch_len=0.5, stretch_wid=0.5)
        self.color("blue")
        self.speed("fastest")
        self.refresh()

    def refresh(self):
        random_x = random.randint(-280, 280)
        random_y = random.randint(-280, 280)
        self.goto(random_x, random_y)
```

The `Food` class in `food.py` is responsible for managing the food's behavior. When initialized, the food is represented by a blue circle. The `refresh()` method generates a random position for the food on the screen.

## Step 4: Creating the `Scoreboard` Class (`scoreboard.py`)

```python
from turtle import Turtle

ALIGNMENT = "center"
FONT = ("Courier", 24, "normal")
file = open("data.txt", mode="r")
read_high_score = file.read()
file.close()

class Scoreboard(Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.score = 0
        self.high_score = int(read_high_score)
        self.color("white")
        self.penup()
        self.goto(0, 270)
        self.hideturtle()
        self.update_scoreboard()

    def update_scoreboard(self):
        self.clear()
        self.write(f"Score: {self.score} Highscore: {self.high_score}", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)

    def reset_game(self):
        if self.score > self.high_score:
            self.high_score = self.score
            with open("data.txt", mode="w") as new_file:
                new_file.write(f"{self.high_score}")

        self.score = 0
        self.update_scoreboard()

    def increase_score(self):
        self.score += 1
        self

.clear()
        self.update_scoreboard()
```

In the `scoreboard.py` file, we define the `Scoreboard` class to manage the game's score. The class handles updating the score, displaying it on the screen, and managing the high score using data stored in a text file (`data.txt`).
